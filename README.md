## ✨ Features by Role

### 👤 1. Employee Dashboard (`/dashboard/employee`)
- **Daily Check-In & Check-Out**: Record daily attendance with a single click.
- **Smart Punctuality**: Automatically marks status as `PRESENT` or `LATE` (if checked in after 9:00 AM).
- **Personal Statistics**: Total present days, late days, and attendance rate percentage.
- **Attendance History**: View past check-in/out records with shift durations (shows latest 5 by default with "Show More" expansion).

### 👔 2. Manager Dashboard (`/dashboard/manager`)
- **Department Scoping**: Managers can strictly access only employees within their assigned department.
- **Department Metrics**: Total team members, present count, late count, and department attendance rate.
- **Interactive Directory**: Search team members by name, email, or employee ID, and filter by attendance status (`Present`, `Late`, `Not Checked In`).

### 👑 3. Admin Dashboard (`/dashboard/admin`)
- **+ Add New Employee Account**: Create new user accounts directly with custom name, email, employee ID, role, and department assignment.
- **Company-Wide Overview**: View organization-wide attendance metrics and department counts.
- **User Directory Management**: Filter and search all registered system users.
- **Role Assignment**: Instantly update user roles (`EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGER`, `ADMIN`).
- **Department Transfer**: Reassign employees to different departments.
- **Account Control**: Activate or deactivate user accounts (prevents unauthorized logins while preserving historical attendance data).
